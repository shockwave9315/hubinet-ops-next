# Status

Status date: 2026-09-08

## Current baseline

- Upstream: Home Assistant Core tag `2026.9.1`, commit
  `fc034572d0216a04ed40a07154394908a594dfed`.
- Baseline tag: `baseline-ha-2026.9.1`.
- Merged runtime: a domain-isolated custom-integration fork of Home Assistant
  Core `proxmoxve`, plus the small package-scan subsystem documented in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Merged

- Clean upstream-derived Proxmox VE integration baseline.
- Reproducible local development and Home Assistant test environment.
- Project-memory foundation defining product, architecture, status,
  provenance, development, and agent responsibilities.
- Manual LXC pending-package scan with no package install/remove/upgrade,
  using AsyncSSH transport, a root-owned forced-command helper, ephemeral
  state, bounded summary entities, and package-specific concurrency.

## Package scan

- Independent read-only architecture audit: **COMPLETE**.
- Package-scan architecture: **ACCEPTED BY MAINTAINER** and documented in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Package scan: **IMPLEMENTED**.
- Package state is intentionally ephemeral; Home Assistant restart resets it.

## Package review

- Package-review architecture: **ACCEPTED BY MAINTAINER** and documented in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Package-review implementation: **NOT STARTED**.

## Next

Implement package review against the accepted architecture.

## Explicitly not started

- Package update: **NOT DESIGNED / NOT STARTED**.
- Post-update health: **NOT DESIGNED / NOT STARTED**.
